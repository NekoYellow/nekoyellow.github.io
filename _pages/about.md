I am a junior in School of Computer Science, Fudan University.

Having initially pursued natural sciences during my first year, I found a passion in the world of algorithms and systems through some exposure to competitive programming, and some serious practicing followed, which ultimately encouraged me to switch to my current major.

I am interested in applications of LLM, as well as AI4S.
